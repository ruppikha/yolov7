## YOLOv7 Trash Detection Project

This project uses the YOLOv7 architecture for detecting trash objects. The dataset used is provided by Roboflow, and the training is conducted using Google Colab and Google Drive for storage.

## Setup and Installation

## Prerequisites

- Google Colab
- Google Drive
- Git
- Python 3.x
- Roboflow account

## Steps

1. **Mount Google Drive**

   Mount your Google Drive to Google Colab to store the dataset and model weights.

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
   ```

2. **Clone YOLOv7 Repository**

   Navigate to your Google Drive and clone the YOLOv7 repository.

   ```python
   %cd /content/gdrive/MyDrive
   !git clone https://github.com/augmentedstartups/yolov7.git
   %cd yolov7
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**

   Install the required dependencies for YOLOv7.

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   !pip install roboflow
   ```

## Downloading the Dataset

1. **Navigate to the YOLOv7 Directory**

   ```python
   %cd /content/gdrive/MyDrive/yolov7
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset from Roboflow**

   Use the Roboflow API to download the dataset.

   ```python
   from roboflow import Roboflow
   rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY")
   project = rf.workspace("your-workspace").project("your-project")
   dataset = project.version(5).download("yolov7")
   ```

## Download YOLOv7 Pre-trained Weights

1. **Download Weights**

   Download the pre-trained YOLOv7 weights from the official repository.

   ```bash
   wget -P /content/gdrive/MyDrive/yolov7 https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt
   ```

## Training the Model

1. **Navigate to the YOLOv7 Directory**

   ```python
   %cd /content/gdrive/MyDrive/yolov7
   ```

2. **Train the Model**

   Use the `train.py` script to start training the model with the downloaded dataset and pre-trained weights.

   ```python
   !python train.py --batch 16 --cfg cfg/training/yolov7.yaml --epochs 55 --data {dataset.location}/data.yaml --weights 'yolov7.pt' --device 0
   ```

## Monitoring Training

1. **TensorBoard**

   Start TensorBoard to monitor the training process.

   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir runs/train
   ```

   Open the displayed link to view the TensorBoard dashboard.

## Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new images. Use the `detect.py` script for inference.

```python
!python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --source your_image_or_video_path
```
